# PRD Feature Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### Phase 1: Quick Fixes ✅
1. **Fixed compilation warnings** - Corrected member initialization order in MainWindow constructor
2. **Implemented antenna recommendations** ✅
   - Created `AntennaRecommendation` class with frequency-based recommendations
   - Added `AntennaWidget` to display recommendations in status bar
   - Integrated research data for optimal antenna selection
   - Updates automatically when frequency changes

### Phase 2: Recording Capabilities ✅
1. **Audio Recording**
   - WAV format implemented with proper headers
   - Support for 16-bit and 24-bit recording
   - Real-time recording status and time display
   - File naming based on frequency, mode, and timestamp
   - Recording directory management

2. **Time-shift Buffer** 
   - 30-minute circular buffer implemented
   - Can save portions of buffer to file
   - Enable/disable control in UI

3. **Scheduled Recording**
   - Framework implemented for timer-based recording
   - Can schedule recordings with start time and duration

4. **UI Integration**
   - `RecordingWidget` with record button, format selector, and status
   - Time-shift controls
   - Recording time display
   - Visual feedback for recording state

### Phase 3: Scanning Functions ✅
1. **Scanner Engine**
   - Frequency scanning with configurable step size
   - Channel scanning for predefined frequencies
   - Memory channel scanning
   - Band scanning within frequency ranges
   - Signal detection with threshold
   - Automatic pause on signal detection
   - Dwell time and resume functionality

2. **Priority Channels**
   - Support for priority channel interrupts
   - Multiple priority levels
   - Periodic checking during scan

3. **UI Integration**
   - `ScannerWidget` with mode selection
   - Speed and threshold controls
   - Progress bar
   - Skip button for active channels
   - Real-time frequency and status display

## Features Not Yet Implemented

### Digital Mode Decoding (Future)
- RDS decoding for FM stations
- CTCSS/DCS tone squelch decoding
- SAME weather alert decoding
- ADS-B aircraft tracking

### Network Features (Future)
- Web interface for remote control
- Audio streaming over network
- Frequency database integration
- DX cluster spotting

### Recording Enhancements (Future)
- FLAC compression support
- MP3 encoding support
- IQ data recording in specialized formats

## Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed initialization order warnings
- Proper memory management with smart pointers
- Thread-safe recording and scanning
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive signal/slot connections

## Integration Notes
All new features are fully integrated with the existing application:
- Recording manager receives processed audio from DSP engine
- Scanner controls RTL-SDR device and monitors signal strength
- Antenna recommendations update based on current frequency
- All widgets follow the vintage military theme
- Settings are saved/loaded with application preferences

## Build Instructions
The application now includes:
```bash
# New source files added to CMakeLists.txt
src/core/AntennaRecommendation.cpp/h
src/audio/RecordingManager.cpp/h
src/dsp/Scanner.cpp/h
src/ui/AntennaWidget.cpp/h
src/ui/RecordingWidget.cpp/h
src/ui/ScannerWidget.cpp/h
```

To build:
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Antenna Recommendations**
   - Tune to different frequencies and verify correct antenna suggestions
   - Click the "?" button to see detailed recommendations

2. **Recording**
   - Test WAV recording at different sample rates
   - Verify time-shift buffer operation
   - Check file naming and directory management

3. **Scanning**
   - Test frequency scanning across FM band
   - Add memory channels and test memory scan
   - Verify signal detection and auto-pause
   - Test skip functionality during active signal

The application now implements the majority of features from the PRD, with a solid foundation for future digital decoding and network features.
