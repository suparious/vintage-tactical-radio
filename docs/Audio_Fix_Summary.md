# Audio Issue Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Initialization Order Warning
**Problem**: Member variables were being initialized in a different order than they were declared in the header file.

**Fix**: Moved `settingsDialog_` declaration to the end of the member variables list in `MainWindow.h` to match the initialization order in the constructor.

### 2. No Audio Output
**Problem**: After moving settings to a separate dialog, audio output wasn't working because:
- Audio device settings weren't being applied before starting audio
- The settings dialog wasn't created before `startRadio()` was called
- Audio device index wasn't being saved/restored properly

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Modified `MainWindow::startRadio()`**: Now properly configures audio output with current settings before starting
2. **Modified `MainWindow` constructor**: Creates the settings dialog during initialization (but doesn't show it)
3. **Modified `SettingsDialog::connectSignals()`**: Now saves the audio device index when changed
4. **Modified `SettingsDialog::populateAudioDevices()`**: Now properly loads and sets the saved audio device

## Code Changes

### MainWindow.h
- Reordered member variables to fix initialization warning

### MainWindow.cpp
- Added `createSettingsDialog()` call in constructor
- Enhanced `startRadio()` to apply audio settings before starting
- Now uses settings from dialog if available, otherwise falls back to saved settings

### SettingsDialog.cpp
- Added audio device index saving when device is changed
- Enhanced device population to restore saved device selection

## Testing Instructions

1. Rebuild the application:
   ```bash
   ./rebuild.sh
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./build/vintage-tactical-radio
   ```

3. Test audio:
   - Start the radio with the START button
   - You should now hear audio output
   - Open Settings from File menu
   - Change audio device and click Apply
   - Audio should switch to the new device

4. Test persistence:
   - Select a non-default audio device in Settings
   - Close and restart the application
   - The selected audio device should be remembered

## Verification

The compilation warnings should be gone, and audio output should work correctly with the settings dialog.
