# Vintage Tactical Radio - PRD Alignment Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to align the Vintage Tactical Radio application with the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## Key Alignments Implemented

### 1. RTL-SDR Hardware Support
- **Gain Range**: Updated from 0-46dB to full 0-49.6dB range as per RTL2832U hardware specifications
- **Direct Sampling**: Automatically enables Q-branch mode for frequencies below 24MHz (HF bands)
- **Sample Rate Control**: Added RTL-SDR sample rate selection (2.048/2.4/2.56/3.2 MHz) with 2.4MHz as default for stability
- **Bias-T Control**: Implemented 4.5V power supply control for active antennas
- **PPM Correction**: Added frequency correction control (-100 to +100 ppm)
- **Optimal Gain**: Automatic gain presets applied based on frequency band

### 2. Audio System Enhancements
- **Sample Rates**: Added 96kHz and 192kHz options (previously only 44.1/48kHz)
- **Sample Format**: 24-bit support already implemented via Qt audio system
- **EQ Presets**: All required presets already implemented:
  - Flat, Full Bass and Treble, Bass Boosted, Treble Cut
  - Radio, Voice, Music, DX (all were already present)

### 3. User Interface Updates
- **Settings Panel**: Added controls for:
  - Bias-T power for active antennas
  - PPM frequency correction
  - RTL-SDR sample rate selection
- **Gain Control**: Updated to support full 49.6dB range
- **Status Display**: Enhanced to show optimal band information

### 4. Packaging and Distribution
Created comprehensive packaging support for all three required formats:

#### Debian Package (.deb)
- Created proper debian/ directory structure
- Control file with all dependencies
- Rules file for building
- Post-install scripts for desktop integration
- Enhanced build script: `build-deb-proper.sh`

#### AppImage
- Already had a functional build script
- Enhanced with Qt6 plugin support
- Includes all assets and themes
- Uses linuxdeploy for better dependency handling

#### Flatpak
- Comprehensive manifest with all permissions
- Includes RTL-SDR and FFTW3 dependencies
- Proper sandboxing configuration
- Build script: `build-flatpak.sh`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Direct Sampling Mode
```cpp
// Automatically enable direct sampling for HF frequencies
DirectSamplingMode newMode = DIRECT_SAMPLING_OFF;
if (freq < 24000000) { // Below 24 MHz
    newMode = DIRECT_SAMPLING_Q; // Q-branch for AM broadcast
}
```

### Optimal Gain Settings
Based on research document, implemented automatic gain selection:
- AM Broadcast (530-1700 kHz): 45.0 dB
- FM Broadcast (88-108 MHz): 25.0 dB  
- VHF Marine (156-162 MHz): 30.0 dB
- Aviation (108-137 MHz): 20.0 dB

### Sample Rate Configuration
RTL-SDR sample rates now configurable:
- 2.048 MHz (for narrowband modes)
- 2.4 MHz (default, recommended for stability)
- 2.56 MHz
- 3.2 MHz (maximum, may have stability issues)

## Remaining Items

### Features Not Yet Implemented
1. **Recording Capabilities**: Audio and IQ recording to WAV/FLAC/MP3
2. **Scanning Functions**: Channel scan, frequency scan, memory scan
3. **Network Features**: Remote control, audio streaming
4. **Digital Modes**: RDS, CTCSS/DCS, SAME, ADS-B decoding
5. **Antenna Recommendations**: UI display of optimal antenna per band

### Technical Improvements Needed
1. **Audio Backend Abstraction**: Currently tied to Qt, needs abstraction for JACK support
2. **SIMD Optimizations**: DSP code could benefit from vectorization
3. **Mock RTL-SDR Mode**: For testing without hardware
4. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for DSP components

## Build Instructions

### Standard Build
```bash
./build.sh
```

### Packaging
```bash
# Debian package
./build-deb-proper.sh

# AppImage
./build-appimage.sh

# Flatpak
./build-flatpak.sh
```

### Make Scripts Executable
```bash
./make-all-executable.sh
```

## Configuration Files

### Settings Storage
- Location: `~/.config/vintage-tactical-radio/`
- Format: JSON
- Includes all user preferences and memory channels

### Memory Channels
- 100 channels (10 banks Ã— 10 channels)
- Stored in `memory_channels.json`
- Quick access channels for common frequencies

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Frequency Coverage**: Test all bands from 530 kHz to 1.7 GHz
2. **Direct Sampling**: Verify automatic mode switching at 24 MHz boundary
3. **Gain Settings**: Confirm optimal presets apply correctly
4. **Audio Rates**: Test all sample rates (44.1/48/96/192 kHz)
5. **Packaging**: Install and run from .deb, AppImage, and Flatpak

## Conclusion

The Vintage Tactical Radio application has been successfully aligned with the PRD requirements. Key hardware features including full gain range, direct sampling, bias-T control, and PPM correction are now implemented. The application supports all required audio configurations and includes comprehensive packaging for Linux distribution.

The vintage military aesthetic is preserved while adding modern SDR capabilities. The application is ready for testing and further development of advanced features like recording, scanning, and digital mode decoding.
