   - Phosphor-style spectrum display

2. **QML Implementation**
   ```qml
   // Example component structure
   VintageRadio {
       FrequencyDial { id: freqDial }
       SpectrumDisplay { id: spectrum }
       SMeter { id: signalMeter }
       ControlPanel { id: controls }
   }
   ```

3. **Visual Effects**
   - CRT-style glow and curvature
   - Realistic wear and aging
   - Smooth animations with physics

#### Phase 4: Features & Polish (Week 5)
1. **Frequency Management**
   - Station database with SQLite
   - Scanning and memory channels
   - Favorites system

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Recording capabilities
   - Plugin system framework
   - Remote control API

3. **Optimization**
   - CPU usage optimization
   - Memory management
   - Real-time audio performance

### 🔧 Key Implementation Details

#### RTL-SDR Configuration
```cpp
// Optimal settings for different bands
struct BandConfig {
    double minFreq;
    double maxFreq;
    uint32_t sampleRate;
    int directSampling; // 0=off, 2=Q-branch for HF
    int gain;           // 0-49 dB
};

// Examples:
BandConfig amBroadcast = {530e3, 1700e3, 2048000, 2, 40};
BandConfig fmBroadcast = {88e6, 108e6, 2400000, 0, 25};
```

#### Audio Processing Pipeline
```
RTL-SDR → IQ Samples → Decimation → Demodulation → 
Audio Filter → Equalizer → Resampler → Audio Output
```

#### Critical Performance Metrics
- Audio latency: < 50ms
- Frequency switching: < 100ms
- CPU usage: < 30% on modern i5
- Memory usage: < 200MB

### 📦 Build and Packaging

#### Development Build
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja
./vintage-tactical-radio
```

#### AppImage Creation
```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_APPIMAGE=ON
ninja
ninja appimage
```

#### Debian Package
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
ninja
cpack -G DEB
```

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Hardware interface mocking
   - DSP algorithm verification
   - State management

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Full signal path validation
   - Audio output verification
   - UI interaction testing

3. **Performance Tests**
   - CPU usage profiling
   - Memory leak detection
   - Real-time constraint validation

### 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines

Remember: This is a VINTAGE MILITARY RADIO!
- Every control should feel mechanical
- Use authentic colors (olive drab, military grey)
- Add subtle imperfections (wear, scratches)
- Sound effects for all interactions
- Phosphor persistence on displays

3. **Qt6 QML Best Practices**: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/best-practices.html
4. **Military Radio References**: See PRD appendix

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't use web technologies** - This is a native app!
2. **Don't oversimplify the UI** - Military radios are complex
3. **Don't ignore real-time constraints** - Audio must not glitch
4. **Don't hardcode frequencies** - Support full RTL-SDR range
5. **Don't forget error handling** - Hardware can disconnect

### 🎯 Success Criteria

Your implementation is successful when:
- [ ] Tunes and demodulates AM/FM broadcasts clearly
- [ ] UI looks authentically vintage/military
- [ ] All controls feel responsive and mechanical
- [ ] Audio has no glitches or dropouts
- [ ] Application uses < 30% CPU on average
- [ ] Can run continuously for 24+ hours
- [ ] Packaged as working AppImage/Deb/Flatpak

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. Start with a working audio pipeline before adding UI
2. Use Qt's signal/slot system extensively
3. Profile early and often
4. Test with real RF signals, not just generated ones
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for everything
6. Make the initial experience magical - add a boot sequence!

Now you're ready to build an amazing vintage tactical radio! The other documents in this folder provide deep technical details for each component. Good luck, and remember - make it feel like authentic military hardware!
