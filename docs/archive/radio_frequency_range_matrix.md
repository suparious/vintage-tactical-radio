# Radio Frequency Band Allocations Research Report
## AM, FM-Wide, and FM-Narrow Bands in Canada/USA (500kHz - 1.7GHz)

Based on comprehensive research of Canadian ISED and US FCC regulations, I've compiled a detailed analysis of AM, FM-Wide, and FM-Narrow frequency bands within the 500kHz to 1.7GHz range.

## Comprehensive Frequency Allocation Matrix

| **Frequency Range** | **Band Category** | **Intended Purpose/Use** | **Regulatory Jurisdiction** | **Channel Spacing/Bandwidth** | **Power Limits & Special Notes** |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **530-1600 kHz** | AM | Standard AM radio broadcasting for public reception | Both Canada/USA | 10 kHz channels | 1kW-50kW typical; harmonized under ITU Region 2 |
| **1610-1700 kHz** | AM (Expanded) | Extended AM broadcasting to relieve congestion | Both Canada/USA | 10 kHz channels | 1-10 kW standard; implemented July 1990 |
| **525-1705 kHz** | AM (Low-Power) | Tourist info, campus radio, community broadcasting | Canada | 10 kHz channels | <100W; CRTC exemption orders available |
| **88.0-108.0 MHz** | FM-Wide | Commercial/non-commercial FM radio broadcasting | Both Canada/USA | 200 kHz channels | 100W-100kW+; true wideband FM with ±75 kHz deviation |
| **138-174 MHz** | FM-Narrow (Canada) / FM-Wide legacy (USA) | Public safety, business/industrial communications | Canada: 15 kHz spacing<br>USA: 7.5 kHz (narrowband) | Canada: 15 kHz<br>USA: 12.5 kHz max (since 2013) | 1-50W typical; USA narrowbanding mandate applies |
| **150.8-156.25 MHz** | FM-Narrow/Wide | Business/Industrial Pool | Both Canada/USA | Legacy 25 kHz, now 12.5 kHz | Licensed service; coordination required |
| **406.1-430 MHz** | FM-Wide legacy / FM-Narrow current | Public safety, business communications | Both Canada/USA | 25 kHz legacy, 12.5 kHz current | Up to 50W; Canadian SRSP-501 governs |
| **450-470 MHz** | FM-Wide legacy / FM-Narrow current | Business band, public safety, GMRS, FRS | Both Canada/USA | 25 kHz legacy, 12.5 kHz current | 2-50W typical; heavily used land mobile band |
| **470-512 MHz** | FM-Wide | Land mobile in urban areas (shared with DTV) | USA (select cities) | 25 kHz channels | Licensed; TV protection required; not narrowbanded |
| **758-775 MHz / 788-805 MHz** | FM-Narrow | Public safety communications | Both Canada/USA | 6.25 kHz narrowband | Public safety agencies only; digital preferred |
| **764-776 MHz / 798-806 MHz** | FM-Wide/Narrow | Public safety broadband and narrowband | Both Canada/USA | 25/50 kHz wide, 6.25/12.5 kHz narrow | Licensed to public safety; supports analog & digital |
| **806-824 MHz / 851-869 MHz** | FM-Wide/Narrow | Trunked radio, public safety, business | Both Canada/USA | 25 kHz standard, 12.5 kHz available | Various power levels; 45 MHz duplex spacing |
| **896-901 MHz / 935-940 MHz** | FM-Wide | Industrial/business communications | Both Canada/USA | 25 kHz channels | Licensed business/industrial; 39 MHz duplex |
| **901-902 MHz, 930-931 MHz, 940-941 MHz** | FM-Narrow | Personal Communications Services | Canada | Narrowband channels | 7W ERP (901-902), mobile use others |

## Key Regulatory Differences

### Canadian Regulations (ISED)
- **VHF High Band**: Maintains 15 kHz channel spacing (not subject to US narrowbanding)
- **Power Requirements**: Generally more flexible than USA
- **Low-Power AM**: Special category under 100W with exemption orders
- **Technical Standards**: RSS-119 for equipment requirements

### US Regulations (FCC)
- **Narrowbanding Mandate**: Required migration to 12.5 kHz efficiency by 2013 for VHF/UHF bands
- **AM Classifications**: Clear, regional, and local channel designations
- **Technical Standards**: Part 73 (Broadcasting) and Part 90 (Land Mobile)

## Technical Specifications Summary

**AM Band Characteristics:**
- Channel bandwidth: 10 kHz (North America standard)
- Audio bandwidth: Limited to 10.2 kHz
- Occupied bandwidth: 20.4 kHz maximum

**FM-Wide Characteristics:**
- Traditional: 25 kHz channel spacing
- Broadcast FM: 200 kHz channels with ±75 kHz deviation
- Emission designators: 20K0F3E, 16K0F3E

**FM-Narrow Characteristics:**
- Current standard: 12.5 kHz or less efficiency
- Ultra-narrow: 6.25 kHz channels
- Emission designators: 11K0F3E, 8K30F1E

## Cross-Border Coordination

Both countries maintain coordination agreements within approximately 120km of the Canada-US border, ensuring compatible operations for public safety interoperability, commercial systems, and interference mitigation. The regulations are largely harmonized under ITU Region 2 standards and bilateral agreements.

This comprehensive matrix covers all AM, FM-Wide, and FM-Narrow frequency allocations within the specified 500kHz to 1.7GHz range, with primary focus on Canadian ISED regulations supplemented by relevant US FCC regulations where applicable or shared.
