   - Multiple scan modes: Frequency, Channel, Memory, Band
   - Signal detection with configurable threshold
   - Automatic pause on signal with dwell time
   - Priority channel support with interrupts

2. **Scanner UI**
   - `ScannerWidget` provides comprehensive controls
   - Mode selection, step size, speed, and threshold
   - Real-time frequency and progress display
   - Skip button for active channels
   - Visual scan progress bar

3. **Integration Features**
   - Scanner uses DSPEngine for signal strength
   - Automatic band parameter updates
   - Memory channel synchronization
   - Frequency changes reflected in main UI

### Phase 4: Complete Integration ✅
1. **MainWindow Integration**
   - All new widgets properly integrated
   - Signal/slot connections established
   - Proper layout management
   - Theme consistency maintained

2. **Feature Interconnections**
   - Recording captures processed audio from DSP
   - Scanner controls main frequency tuning
   - Memory channels available to scanner
   - Antenna recommendations update on any frequency change

3. **Settings Persistence**
   - Scanner parameters saved/loaded
   - Recording directory preferences
   - Memory channel persistence
   - All settings integrated with existing system

## Technical Achievements
